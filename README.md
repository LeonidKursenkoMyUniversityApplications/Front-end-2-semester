# Front-end
This repository contains my student projects on the subject of front-end. This repository contains 5 practical works that includes:
1) LW01 performs tasks dedicated to JavaScript and npm;
2) LW02 performs tasks dedicated to NodeJS, ES-2015, Webpack@4 and LESS 
(To start executing the project is used the npm command `npm run start`).

This practical works were created during my fourth-year studies in 2018.
